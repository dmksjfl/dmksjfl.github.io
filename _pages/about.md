I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University supervised by Prof. [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&hl=en). I am now working as a group leader of Reinforcement Learning Group of Intelligent Computing Lab (ICLAB). I receive my bachelor’s degree from the Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University in 2020.

I am fortunate to work closely with Prof. [Zongqing Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k3IFtTYAAAAJ&hl=en) from Peking University. I am now an intern student at Game AI Research Center, Tencent IEG (Interactive Entertainment Group), supervised by Mr. Le Wan and Mr. Jingwen Yang. Before that, I was an intern student at Pengcheng Lab (PCL) supervised by Prof. [Zongqing Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k3IFtTYAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in efficient decision-making with deep Reinforcement Learning, including offline RL, sample-efficient general online model-free RL, and model-based RL. Meanwhile, I am interested in deploying RL algorithms in real-world applications, such as robotics, traffic signal control, etc.

Please feel free to drop me an e-mail if you are interested in collaborating with me. lvjf20[AT]mails.tsinghua.edu.cn
